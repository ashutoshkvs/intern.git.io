                <h3 class="d-none">Unravelling the four generations in our workplace</h3>
                <p>The past few months have kept HR folks and business managers amused! Our employees – primarily
                    Millennials and Gen Z – moved out of jobs, sought sky-high pay hikes, and then some started to
                    trickle back to their previous organisations. With this boomerang, the focus has also moved to
                    certain generations at workplace that demonstrated this behaviour more than others. For the first
                    time in modern history, four different generations are at the workplace together. The Baby Boomers
                    have just begun retiring but the other three are still very active in the workplace dynamics.</p>
                <p>Owing to a greater focus on overall wellness, technological advances in medical sciences and a more
                    active lifestyle of employees, Baby Boomers are retiring later than any of the previous generations
                    did. On the other hand, Gen Z is entering the workforce before any other generation has. They are
                    breaking the traditional moulds of education and are beginning to work even before completing their
                    graduation in the form of internships, secondments or moonlighting assignments. In this three-part
                    blog series, I hope to highlight that managing the needs of this diverse workforce may be
                    challenging, but if handled well, it can help the organisation reap multiple benefits. First, let’s
                    unwrap these four generations and what they bring to workplaces.</p>
                <p>A lot has been written about the differences between the four generations – their values, beliefs and
                    worldviews. As a construct, ‘generation’ is complex to unravel. As a sociological construct, it has
                    been loosely defined as</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>“an identifiable group that shares birth years, age, location and significant life events at
                        critical developmental stages”</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>(- Betty Kupperschmidt, <a
                                href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12146706_Multigeneration_Employees_Strategies_for_Effective_Management">Multigeneration
                                Employees: Strategies for Effective Management</a>, 2000).</p>
                    </blockquote>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Generations are largely moulded by historical and economic events too. <a
                        href="https://www.fourthturning.com/">Strauss and Howe</a> therefore see generations as a cohort
                    of people born within a 20–30-year phase or ‘turnings’. According to them, historical events have
                    repeatedly shaped the values and beliefs of a generational group, which they have categorised into
                    four distinct archetypes – Prophet, Nomad, Hero, and Artist. Together these four archetypes manifest
                    in the form of a <em>saeculum</em>, roughly over a period of a hundred years – only to be repeated
                    again.</p>
                <p>When overlayered by regional and cultural differences, the manifestations of a generation differ
                    vastly. For example, the very age brackets of the four generations differs in India from their
                    American counterparts. This is because the events that have triggered a generation to emerge in one
                    country were delayed or deleted in another country. As an example, the Baby Boomers of the U.S. are
                    largely shaped by the post-World War II events and the Cold War disaffections. However, the Indian
                    Baby Boomers grew up in the post-Independence era of constrained resources and opportunities with
                    pre-liberalisation policies.</p>
                <p>Similarly, as a culture, India perceives generational diversity at a workplace differently as
                    compared to other societies. Having experienced multi-generational diversity in their personal and
                    social realms, most managers are akin to working with other generations. Indian organisations,
                    therefore, experience different challenges and opportunities as compared to those in low power
                    distance cultures.</p>
                <p>Values have a significant role to play within this multigenerational intermingling. <a
                        href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/41683958">Lyons et al.</a> defined work values as generalized
                    beliefs about the desirable aspects of work and are known to impact motivation, organizational
                    commitment, decision making, career choice, and organizational citizenship behaviour.</p>
                <p>According to <a
                        href="https://epublications.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=cps_professional">Arsenault
                        and Patrick</a>, some of the core values associated with each of the first three generational
                    cohorts are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The core values of the Baby Boomers are optimism, personal gratification, and growth. In fact,
                        in the 1970s, the term “workaholic” was coined by <a
                            href="https://scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=91076">Zemke</a> to describe
                        the driven work ethic of the Baby Boomers.</li>
                    <li>The core values of Generation X are diversity, techno-literacy, fun, and informality.</li>
                    <li>The core values of the Millennials are optimism, civic duty, confidence, and achievement.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The impact of these values transmits to the ways in which they bring themselves to work. Each
                    generation brings with it a different backstory leading from the different value systems and
                    worldview they display. Creating a safe space to share these stories and an open, trusting culture
                    where everyone’s worldview is understood is critical to building an age-diverse environment at work.
                </p>
                <p>In most workplaces, unless consciously wired, these different work styles can lead to tensions and
                    productivity losses. The next blog post in the series looks at some of the challenges faced by
                    organisations when the four generations interact at a single workplace.</p>
